# Visual-Similarity
In this project, I built a visual similarity recommendation system capable of recieving an image and recommending similar images based on their visual similarity. The recommendation system is powered by the convolutional neural network which serves as a feature extractor after which cosine similarity is computed to derive similarity scores between images.
